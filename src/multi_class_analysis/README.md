To change the data path, change the string on line 15 of `prepare_data.py`.


To train the model & view the conf matrix, open `train_machine_learning_model.py` and change line 54 `use_precomputed=True` to `use_precomputed=False`. Then run the file.

The other filenames should be fairly self explanatory.
